### Hi there 👋

Hi I am Majid, I am software developer with more than 12 years of experience in front and back end technologies. I have hands on experience with object oriented languages such as Java and python. I have also developed projects with Javascript (vanilla projects, & React.js). Currently I am in my last semester studying blockchain development in George Brown College – Toronto and I have learned solidity and Hyperledger Fabric.
